= GameDeals
Doc Writer <julius.dehner@gmail.com>

== Work in progress!

== Description

Finished features:

- get current deals from r/GameDeals
- check if the game has at least 1000 ratings on steam
- compare prices with G2A

TODOs:

- message you on Telegram, when there is a certain profit margin by selling the game on G2A
- test cases
- proper logging

Features I might implement:

- creating graphs of price develpment while on sale (probably using bokeh)
- writing a message on telegram to track game sales regardless of G2A prices
