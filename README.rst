Description
===========
Finished features:

- get current deals from r/GameDeals 
- check if the game has at least 1000 ratings on steam
- compare prices with G2A

TODOs:

- message you on Telegram, when there is a certain profit margin by selling the game on G2A
- test cases
- proper logging

Features I might implement:

- creating graphs of price develpment while on sale
- writing a message on telegram to track game sales regardless of G2A prices
